=========================================
Notes:
=========================================
This map is a partial remake of the Red Alert 2 map, Let There Be Fight. The reason it is a partial remake
is that I decided to add more water and a middle island for more strategic options. There is only 1 entry point
into each of the starting positions, with 2 Ore Nodes close by (1 on water and 1 on land) to expand to. There
is also an Oil Derrick nearby for an extra income boost. The middle island holds 2 Ore Nodes and can be
easily cut off from the enemy. The use of a Navy will prove very useful in taking out bases.

Enjoy
