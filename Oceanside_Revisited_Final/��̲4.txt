Map Information:

Name: 			Oceanside Revisited
Author: 		ZeNewk & Acid_Cr@sh
Size:			700x550
Players: 		2-4, 2vs2 recommended

==============================================
Description:

Map based on the original Oceanside map from Red Alert 2 Yuris Revenge.
It consists of 4 unique assymetrical islands for base bulding and a central platform with tech structures 
and Ore Nodes of strategical value.

==============================================
Gameplay notes: 

1) To balance the gameplay (Ore Node and tech structures locations) 
   suggest choosing starting locations this way:

Classical gameplay:	Team 1 - on left and top start locations 
			Team 2 - on right and bottom start locations

Intense gameplay:	Team 1 - on top and bottom start locations
			Team 2 - on left and right start locations


2) Player can avoid early infantry rushes by destroing bridges next to him.
3) Every Player has 2 Ore Nodes avaliable instantly and 1 Ore Node that requires expansion but still is located nearby on land.
4) Every Player has a tech structure on his island that can be captured easy and quiclky.
5) There are 3 Oil Derricks in corners of map that can boost economy on early stages of game. Suggest taking them as soon as possible!
6) There is a very low propability that you can win this battle without a naval force.

==============================================
