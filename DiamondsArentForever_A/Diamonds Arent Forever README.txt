		Notes from Author:

My second map for RA3, which is another remake, of the RA1 map Diamonds Aren't Forever. For those who don't know, this map was part of The Aftermath expansion for Red Alert 1. This map was so much fun, and kept me and a friend playing the game for literally hundreds of hours on the PS1 and PC! 
Originally named for its only source of money: gems/crystals, all on the central island and outer islands, this map plays into the hands of RA3's naval aspects quite nicely.

This map has taken me a very long time to complete, and includes more than double the amount of detail than that which I put into my remake of Hostile Dawn. So I hope you like it :-)

THIS MAP COMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT VERSIONS!

Multiple versions of map made for choice of game setup, and works as follows:
Diamonds Aren't Forever | A = Left vs Right
Diamonds Aren't Forever | B = Top vs Bottom
Diamonds Aren't Forever | S = Left vs Right (Special)

The special version of the map, S, disables all ultimate weapons and various protocols for the ultimate in skirmish play. Disabled protocols are:

Allied Surgical Strike, Timebomb, Chronorift and Cryogeddon powers (all tiers) & the Proton Collider.
Soviet Orbital drop, Desolator Airstrike, Magnetic Satellite and Magnetic Singularity (all tiers) & the Vacuum Imploder.
Empire Tankbuster Ambush, Balloon Bombs and Final Squadron powers (all tiers) & the Psionic Dominator.

This isn't tested for balance issues at all, but is simply aimed at those players who like to play without protocols and SW's, and is more for skirmish play than online.

		Final Version Notes:

Final comes complete with the following:

- Cliff height corrected on LHS of map
- Texture addition to most beaches
- Official style minimap added (Thanks Acid_Crash!)
- Ore nodes on central island moved back a square to help clear the houses
- Multiple map versions, including a special no protocol & SW gametype!
- Middle-right Lighthouse now able to be garrisoned

=====================================================================================================

		Beta1 Version Notes:

Beta1 comes complete with the following:

- Impassable terrain painted around cliffs to help stop units "hiding inside" them
- Bloom
- Custom lighting
- Sounds

Although it has a minimap/radar, its not to the RA3 "cartoon" standard. Yet >:D
